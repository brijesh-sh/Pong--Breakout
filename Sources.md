## Aside

<p>I've always loved video games. I started when I was 8 on the NES, but  Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 was one of my earliest favourites. I have fondest memories of the PlayStation 2. My brothers and I shared a single console in our household, so we would gather around and watch the eldest play for hours. IIt was always a fun bonding experience. It's always been about bonding with friends and family, and I only play when spending time with them.</p>
<p>For me, video games are all about the art. I'm all about the environments, the art style, and the NPCs living their virtual lives. I admire talented artists who create immersive and lived-in virtual environments. I love how all these elements, combined with AI systems like the [Nemesis System]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm_AzK27mZY), can create mini-worlds that feel like real places, with unpredictable and evolving narratives. If I can carve out the time, I have some ideas for a small-scale simulation. </p>
<p>I also like playing story-driven games from time to time. Recently, I played The Last of Us and was blown away by how amazing it was. It is a tightly-woven masterpiece- the storytelling was top-notch, the characters complex, and the narrative heart-wrenching. Plus, it's been adapted into an HBO show currently running and getting great reviews.
